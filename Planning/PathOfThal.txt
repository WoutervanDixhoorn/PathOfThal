/**
    *Project planning
    Title: Path Of Thal
*/

/**
    *What's the game about
        You take a step in the life of a Neanderthal 'Thal'. Have to complete a number of tasks to make
        progression. The goal of the game is to escape living in fear. It is a story type of game where the
        balance between adventure and descision making is key.

    *Format of the game / story
        Top down RPG like. Exlpore a vast world (Probably pixel like). Collect wood
        to stay warm. Collect plants and kill animals to stay alive, lack of food will decreas your speed and such.
        Sell collectables for food or materials to stay alive. Barter is also a decent part of the game.

/**

    *Features
        * Maybe a sidescroller combination would be fun. Like mario. Control from the top and have scripted events
          that have a sidescroller layout.

/**
    *Map data structure
        * Needs to hold terrain data
        * Needs to hold npc refrence //So the game knows what npc file it needs to put where
        * Needs to hold the state of changeble objects in game //For example a piece of wood that can be picked up
        * Needs to hold collision data. //So solid objects are a thing
            /*
                *Think the best way to have a map by having one file per screen. every
                *screen has 'layers'. Each layer has certain information, for example: *What tiles to put where.
                                                                                       *A region with a function // A function can be 'Solid' or 'Event-1'
                                                                                                                 // wich is then linked to an event file.
            */

    *Player data structure
        * Needs to hold players health
        * Needs to hold players position
        * Needs to hold players inventory data //Maybe seperate encrypted file so players cant just cheat
        * Needs to hold some sort of achievement tree //Maybe seperate encrypted file so players cant just cheat
        * Needs to hold information about what quests the player did //For example 'Stage 2 in "A piece of log"'

    *Scripted events
        * Maybe some sort of event that only happens at night, rituals of some sort to alter your luck by offering animal/collectebles to the gods

    * Npc data structure
        * Needs to hold data about what they can trade //For example piece of log for five apples
        * Needs to hold the position of the npc
        * Needs to hold what sprite npc uses
        * Needs to hold quest info //Dialogs, objectives and progression

    *Animation Sysyem
        * Some sort of handler that handles all the animation data for me //This can be aplied on every entity/image
